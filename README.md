# ruby_home

ruby_home is an implementation of the HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) to create your own HomeKit accessory in Ruby. HomeKit is a set of protocols and libraries to access devices for home automation. A non-commercial version of the protocol documentation is available on the [HomeKit developer website](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ruby_home'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ruby_home

## Usage

Create a fan with an on/off switch.

```ruby
require 'ruby_home'

accessory_information = RubyHome::AccessoryFactory.create(:accessory_information)
fan = RubyHome::AccessoryFactory.create(:fan)

fan.characteristic(:on).on(:updated) do |new_value|
  if new_value == 1
    puts "Fan switched on"
  else
    puts "Fan switched off"
  end
end

RubyHome.run
```

Create a garage door opener.

```ruby
require 'ruby_home'

accessory_information = RubyHome::AccessoryFactory.create(:accessory_information)
door = RubyHome::AccessoryFactory.create(:garage_door_opener)

door.characteristic(:target_door_state).on(:updated, async: true) do |new_value|
  if new_value == 0 # open
    sleep 1
    door.characteristic(:current_door_state).value = 0
  elsif new_value == 1 #closed
    sleep 1
    door.characteristic(:current_door_state).value = 1
  end
end

RubyHome.run
```
